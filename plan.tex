  Can a language be defined, such that it is a subset of \texttt{Regular Expressions}, where most control characters are replaced by assumptions? Where the intent of the subset is to express annotations of document hierarchy.

\section{Research questions}
The question of interest is as follows.

\firstresearchquestion

Given that there are a multitude of potentials solutions to the question, one path must be chosen. This thesis concerns itself with the approach outlined in the more detailed question below.

\secondresearchquestion

To explore the possibility of the above question the author has chosen to evaluate whether \texttt{Regular Expressions} can be used to define annotation rules that enables an annotated document to be converted into \texttt{XML}. As expressed by the question below:

\thirdresearchquestion

Given that \texttt{Regular Expressions} may cause the level of complexity to increase (which previously stated as explicitly unwanted) the author has chosen to suggest the use of a simplified subset of the language. As expressed in the question below:
